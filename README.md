<h2>Description</h2>
The project is a walkthrough of the basic Microsoft Azure Cloud services. Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services such as virtual machines, storage, databases, analytics, etc.  Azure resource group is a logical container that holds related resources such as virtual machines, storage accounts, databases, and network interfaces.
<br />
<h2>Environment Used </h2>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>
<h4><b>"AZURE RESOURCE GROUP"</b></h4>
A Resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. It helps for better management and deployment. During creation, you need to give the resource group <b>a unique name</b>. You must also choose <b>a region</b> that will hold the resources.

<h4><b>"AZURE VIRTUAL MACHINE (VM) CREATION"</b></h4>
Azure VM is a computing service that allows users to host their applications or systems in the cloud on Windows and Linux operating systems.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>"WINDOWS 10 VM"</b> is created in the resource group. This machine would be accessed using <b>Remote Desktop</b> from client machine.

<br/>
<b>"LINUX (UBUNTU) VM"</b> is created in the resource group. This machine would be accessed using <b>SSH (Secured Shell) protocol via PowerShell</b> from the client machine.
